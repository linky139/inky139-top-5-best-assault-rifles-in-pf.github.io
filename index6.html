    <h1>THE AK47</h1>
    <p>History
        The AK47 (Russian: Aвтома́т Kала́шникова 1947 or Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947) is a gas-operated, rotating bolt assault rifle designed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. The design of the AK47 began in 1945. Mikhail Kalashnikov and his team sought to create an automatic rifle that would replace the Mosin Nagant and various submachine guns in active Soviet military service as a standard infantry weapon. The AK47 incorporated and shares design elements from the German Sturmgewehr-44 (STG-44), one of the first true modern-day assault rifles. Both rifles feature select-fire capabilities, feed from a 30-round curved box magazine, and are both chambered for intermediate cartridges.
        
        The AK47 was chambered in the then newly developed Soviet 7.62×39mm round—an intermediate cartridge that took influence from the German 7.92×33mm Kurz round used in the STG-44. This caliber was first used in the RPD and SKS. It was designed to be a compromise between the full-sized 7.62×54mmR rifle round and smaller 7.62×25mm Tokarev round used in pistols and submachine guns. In 1946, the AK47 was presented for official military trials. In 1948, fixed stock versions were introduced to select units of the Red Army, and in 1949, it was officially issued to the Red Army.
        
        The AK47 was designed to be a simple, reliable and durable automatic rifle that could be manufactured in large quantities at a relatively low price. Its robust design allows it to endure large amounts of debris and fouling without causing malfunction or needed complex maintenance. For these reasons, the AK47 has seen service in countless conflicts around the world, used by armies and irregular forces alike, and continues to be manufactured today by various companies around the world.
        
        In 1959, the AK47 was replaced by the AKM as the standard service rifle in the Red Army. While the weapons are no longer in service with current Russian forces, they are still used by police, militia, prison guards, etc., and can commonly be found on the second-hand market.
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The AK47 is a risk, reward assault rifle. It sports very powerful damage, dealing the highest amount damage at close range out of all the assault rifles, with a three-shot kill (3SK) anywhere to the body within its maximum damage range. It can two-shot kill with a headshot and a limb shot up to 80 studs. Within its maximum damage range, it can also deliver a 2SK with one headshot, the only assault rifle capable of doing so. However, it also has very high recoil, making it especially difficult to control in fully-automatic fire. It also has a low RoF, firing at 600 RPM—behind many of the modern assault rifles in its category.
        
        The range is good, with its 3SK lasting past 100 studs. Muzzle velocity is below-average, at 2000 studs/s. However, due to the high damage, the time to kill (TTK) of the AK47 remains quite low at all ranges. The AK47 also boasts good penetration.
        
        Usage &amp; Tactics
        Attachments such as the Muzzle Brake and the Angled Grip are highly recommended to improve the weapon's handling, given its high recoil, but, there is another option, using the Stubby Grip to greatly reduce the Gun/ADS recoil to a near minimum. It also has a high amount of muzzle flash, so a Flash Hider can be useful.
        
        Shot placement is key with the AK47. As stated before, it is the only assault rifle that can two-shot with a single headshot. Its high vertical recoil can actually assist with this; with practice, a user could easily aim for the torso and let the second shot kick up into the enemy's head. This 'varying shot placement' (due to recoil) feature common among LMGs means the user can be slightly less conservative about perfect shot placement, though the lower ROF on the weapon means a user must take caution when attacking an enemy.
        
        When used in semi-automatic mode and with select optics, the AK47 can be used as a pseudo-designated marksman rifle, behaving similarly to the SKS. At long range, landing headshots can reduce the shots to kill (STK) from four to three. Combined with its high maximum damage, the AK47 can perform competitively at any range. Although, it does have a lower than average muzzle velocity, so at longer ranges, one must lean their shots more in order to hit their targets.
        
        For a hybrid approach, a high power optic (such as the VCOG 6x Scope, PKA-S, and ACOG Scope) can be equipped alongside a range of grips and laser sights. These attachments are used by using the high power optic when a target is spotted at longer ranges, and hip firing in close-quarters-combat (CQC). But, if you want to be on the aggressive, it is best to use a Coyote Sight or a Reflex Sight due to it being a low-power-optic. Optics such as the MARS which are mounted higher on the weapon can help to compensate for the weapon's vertical recoil and camera recoil.
        
        Conclusion
        The AK47 is a gun that combines both the range and power of a DMR with the magazine size and RoF of an assault rifle. The combination of these two traits makes the AK47 a force to be reckoned with, both in CQC and long-range. The recoil and lower rate of fire, however, must be taken into account when using the weapon, as they make the weapon more difficult to tame than other Assault Rifles.</p>
