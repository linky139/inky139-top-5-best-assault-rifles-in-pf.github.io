    <h1>THE G36</h1>
    <p>History
        In 1990, Heckler and Koch (H&amp;K) began working on a new 5.56Ã—45mm NATO Assault Rifle, to replace the larger-caliber G3 battle rifle. The rifle was designed from the ground up and was designated "Project 50" or HK50. The prototype was trialed against the Austrian Steyr AUG, where it was rated better. The weapon was finalized in 1995, with production commencing a year later. The HK50 rifle was adopted by the German Bundeswehr in 1997 as its standard-issue rifle, under the designation Gewehr 36, or G36.
        
        Multiple variants were derived from the original G36. Notable variants include the G36C, a sub-carbine variant and the MG36, a light machine gun variant which features a heavier barrel, bipod, and 100-round Beta C magazine.[1]
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The G36 is a long range oriented assault rifle, possessing a balance between firepower, recoil control while aiming, rate of fire and range. However, the camera recoil is bouncy and the hip fire leaves much to be desired with its tendency to sway away from targets. The G36 has and retains a 4-shot kill (4SK) at all ranges and a high muzzle velocity, similar to the L85A2. This lets it function as a faster firing alternative to something like a designated marksman rifle.
        
        While aiming, the initial recoil has a strong bounce to it. In fully automatic fire, it will make the gun rise up quite a bit, then hold stable after the third shot. Despite beginning with a strong kick, the recoil recovery of the G36 is quite fast, as even rapid tap fire is accurate enough to hit enemies with ease up to 150 studs. The hip fire, however, is the complete opposite. The recoil is random, uncontrollable and spread in a wide pattern, even worse than some 7.62 NATO assault rifles and the battle rifles. The recoil is similar to the M60 in that the weapon will begin to pivot off target under sustained fire.
        
        Usage &amp; Tactics
        While using the G36, one should keep in mind that it does not particularly excel at short range, but performs better at medium and long ranges. Due to this, close-quarters-combat (CQC) is not recommended with the G36. It would be preferable to switch to a secondary weapon in case such a situation arises. On the other hand, the G36's sway may come in handy when dealing with more than one hostile at close range, as the G36 will naturally sweep slowly in one direction before turning around back to the other direction with a sharp flick. Unfortunately, not even the vertical grip can do much to temper the poor hipfire performance.
        
        Remember that the G36 shines at longer ranges where it has room to breathe. At its practical range, one can use its high muzzle velocity combined with its fast fire rate to rapidly pick out enemies one by one, much like a DMR. Recoil constraining attachments are always welcome while aiming. However, be aware that even with recoil constraining attachments, the G36 still lacks some stability, meaning that it may sway off target at distance. Remember to tap-fire with caution, even if it exposes the G36's strong initial recoil forces.
        
        Conclusion
        The G36 is a gun tailored for long range engagement, capable of heavily suppressing skilled snipers where other assault rifles cannot. Despite all of its long range boons however, in stock form, the G36 has unfavorable recoil for the job, and lacks hipfire stability in general, making it a poor candidate for close range cleanup without a tactical advantage on the user's part.</p>
